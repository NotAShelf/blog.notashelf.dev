       <p>Hi all, good news first. I am a <strong>Release Editor for
NixOS 25.05</strong>. This is a bit difficult for me to talk about,
since I do not know what exactly what it entails <em>yet</em> but know
that I am excited about it, and I wanted to share it with you dear
reader. It has been one <em>hell</em> of a journey so far, I am excited
to see what is to come. NixOS, with its flaws, has a special place in my
heart and it is great to be able to finally play a part in the grand
scheme of things.</p>
<div class="reading-time">
<p>8 minute read</p>
</div>
<p>There are a few articles that I am working on, one of them being the
continuation to the NixOS hardening series. Unfortunately there is not
much time on my hands, and my backlog is filling up again. Worry not
though, they are coming along nicely. I also have some technical rants
on the horizon, since I have not written one of those in a while. Until
I get the time to finish those, enjoy this heart-felt rambling on
editors and the heart-to-heart in an unusual pace.</p>
<h2 id="on-editors" id="on-editors">On
Editors <a href="#on-editors" class="anchor-link">üîó</a></h2>
<p>I do a lot of, well, editing on my computer. This is sometimes for
academic essays that I have to write myself, or sometimes academic
essays that I have to proofread but it usually involves me sitting in
front of a computer screen for hours on end and simply type away. Thanks
to the relative leniency of my department, I have been able to use LaTeX
in the past and more recently I have been enjoying <a
href="https://typst.app">Typst</a>. Much of this editing, regardless of
the framework, involves an editor. While would be all too simple to use
something like Libreoffice, I rarely find myself opening
<code>.docx</code> files to edit an essay, even less rare to be writing
in one. What I use for most of my editing is, of course, my trusty
Neovim setup.</p>
<p>Neovim holds an interesting place in my tool belt. I have switched
off VSCode‚Äìthe editor I have started with‚Äì due to its annoyingly high
RAM usage and power draw on my laptop, which made it less than ideal for
when I could not easily find a place to plug my charger. Around the same
time I was learning about Linux (and customizing the hell out of my
Archlinux setup) so it eventually lead to me checking out Neovim. It was
something reminiscent of love at first sight. It was all snappy and
intuitive and simple, I could not have asked for a better editor. Neovim
<em>was</em> what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Over time I began adding plugins, usually to add features that I was
missing from VSCode. LSPs and debugger plugins quickly found their way
into my configuration, and over time Neovim was not quite what it first
was. It had become sluggish, and complex. Worse, it had become
inconsistent with the number of plugins that all insist that their way
of doings things is the correct one. Around this time, I switched to
NixOS and began thinking about setting up Neovim declaratively on my
system. <code>programs.neovim</code> was not quite intuitive, and
linking a <code>nvim</code> directory to <code>~/.config/nvim</code>
felt less than ideal. This lead to <em>neovim-flake</em>. I cannot quite
call it my creation, as I have soft-forked it from a project with the
same name by Jordan Isaacs but I had many different, conflicting ideas
in mind. So much so, that it warranted the soft-fork to take it in a
different direction. neovim-flake, the original one, was a learning
experience. I learned a lot about how to write Nix, and I also learned
how <em>not</em> to write Nix. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A not-so-recent discovery that I have made is that I learn by doing.
<em>Explicitly</em> by doing. Little bit (a lot) of research later, I
found the state of academia to be be‚Ä¶ disappointing, to say the least.
There is a need for greater adoption of evidence-based cognitive
learning strategies in educational settings and despite their proven
effectiveness, teacher training programs often do not appear to be
covering any cognitive learning processes. This, unfortunately, leads to
many students (such as myself) distancing themselves from the education
system entirely. Although I do not feel equipped to do more than just to
observe. If you <em>are</em>, however, an expert in the field perhaps
reach out to me. I would love to hear about your thoughts as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was saying, neovim-flake‚Äìnow nvf‚Äìwas a learning experience. More
importantly, it was a testing ground for my ‚Äúideal‚Äù Neovim
configuration. I have learned about Neovim as much as I have learned
about Nix by maintaining nvf. The most important discovery while working
on nvf and Neovim, was that <strong>Neovim is a subpar editor</strong>.
I mean this in an endearing way of course, I would want my editor to
become better and I think it is moving in the right direction, however,
with contenders such as Helix now challenging Neovim‚Äôs place it
<em>might</em> be the time to reconsider priorities and re-allocate
resources. Although I am uninterested in Helix <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, it
has pushed‚Äìmoreso, nudged Neovim in the correct direction by looking at
Neovim‚Äôs long-time mistakes and working on fixing them. For one, Helix
boasts a more consistent interface for features that are only available
as plugins on Neovim. There is no conflicting design choices or UI
decisions. Not yet, anyway. I think consistent UI is a good thing to
have in your editor, however good your UX may be.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned above, Neovim has started moving in the correct
direction with some of the core-features of Helix stealing the hearts of
many Neovim users. After a very underwhelming 0.10 release, I believe
0.11 is taking Neovim in a better direction by analyzing the core
demands of the community and trying to implement them as a part of the
editor, in response to the needs and demands. The new LSP interface
appears very interesting, though I would be equally happy to see a
consistent interface for linters and formatters. null-ls (now none-ls)
has been a frustrating experience, with how slow and clunky it is.
none-ls doubled down on complexity by moving feature-complete builtins
to a different repo, which you have to fetch and load yourself. This is
<em>not</em> how an editor should function. Taking from Helix, I would
be delighted to see some of the plugin exclusive features as parts of
the core editor. Although, this might be wishful thinking. So far, I am
excited for the prospect of natively configuring LSPs and a few UI
additions that I have been looking forward to. Perhaps I‚Äôll write about
Neovim again when 0.11 drops. There is also the less commonly talked
about <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/27339">snippet
engine</a> that will be built into Neovim with 0.11. Those are all very
welcome additions, and it is a great time to be a Neovim user.</p>
<p>For the time being, I have been aggressively dropping plugins that I
don‚Äôt <em>really</em> need or rewriting them myself as more efficient
autocommands as parts of my configuration. This seems to have helped
with the startup times, as some Neovim plugins are <em>very</em>
inefficient. I have also dropped nvim-cmp because how how slow it was,
but blink.nvim is restoring my ‚Äúfaith‚Äù in completion plugins again. The
<a href="https://github.com/Saghen/frizbee">frizbee</a> matcher is quite
fast, and hopefully it will be utilized better in the future. On that
note, I encourage you to do the same. Learning Lua is trivial, and if
you have experience with programming you might be able to find far
smarter implementations to problems ‚Äúsolved‚Äù by small convenience
plugins.</p>
<h2 id="on-things" id="on-things">On
Things <a href="#on-things" class="anchor-link">üîó</a></h2>
<p>On a more emotional side, I have been very burnt out with things. If
you use any of my projects, you might have noticed that they have not
been maintained on their usual pace for a while now. This is not
permanent, I have <em>many</em> plans but unfortunately not enough time
to follow through <em>for now</em>. Expect the language modules to be
improved for <a href="https://github.com/notashelf/nvf">nvf</a> in the
near future, and an internal rewrite of <a
href="https://github.com/schizofox/schizofox">Schizofox</a>. <a
href="https://github.com/feel-co/hjem">Hjem</a> is, fortunately, a team
project and is able to proceed with and without me. I consider other
public software (such as <a
href="https://github.com/notashelf/microfetch">Microfetch</a>) I‚Äôve
created to be stable, but perhaps they will be picked back up as well. I
have been meaning to make Microfetch even faster (can‚Äôt stop won‚Äôt stop)
for a while now‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Regardless, there are a nice things in the future but I first need
some free time. Working on a few projects, and it is almost the busy
season at $WORK. But I digress. Wanted to give you this as a progress
report, and to explain the reasoning behind my absence. Some of those
projects have been getting a lot of attention, even with my absence, so
I wanted to personally thank everyone who has been submitting pull
requests. You may not think much of it, but it means much to me that you
have taken the time to contribute to the project(s).</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts" id="closing-thoughts">Closing
Thoughts <a href="#closing-thoughts" class="anchor-link">üîó</a></h2>
<p>If this reads off as a little pessimistic, worry not. Nothing is
changing anytime soon, or at least nothing is changing for the
<em>worse</em> anytime soon. I will continue writing on this blog, and I
will continue working on nvf as Neovim appears to be my forever editor.
This was a temporary break from my usual pace of detailed, technical
writing that takes more time and an opportunity to get some things off
my chest, or out of my mind. As I‚Äôve said before, there are multiple
articles in the writing, but I would like to hear what you think I
should write about too. Nix ecosystem is weirdly obscure, and sometimes
independent blog articles do better than official documentation for
learning.</p>
<p>If you have read this far, thank you. I would also like to hear your
thoughts on an of the things I‚Äôve talked about above. Feel free to reach
out to me anytime. That said, this is all I have time for today. Thank
you for reading.</p>
