The first page of Dostoyevsky's _Notes From Underground_ has always been
fascinating to me. Not because I fully relate to this sick, spiteful,
unattractive man, but because I share a sentiment with him: spite. I have always
carried it with me, as long as I have been self-aware. I do things when I'm
spiteful; I do things _because_ I am spiteful, and it usually becomes a strange
mixture of emotions, actions, and sentiments that gets me results.

I am in pain. I have been for as long as I can remember. My leg hurts, my hand
hurts, and now my neck hurts. Age? Sports injury? Your guess is as good as mine.
Yet despite all that, in spite of the pain, I prevail. I walk, I run, I lift, I
write, I draw, and many more. It hurts? Sure, let it get worse.

One of the first things I have learned was trust---or rather, mistrust---shortly
after spite. It was fairly obvious. Simply figuring out ways I can do things
myself is more cost effective. Simply put, I don't trust. Not anyone but myself.
Sure, I will share responsibilities _some of the time_ if I deem the cost
insignificant, but when there are stakes that matter, then I am alone. Which is
usually always. Surrounded by people whom I love, but alone, nevertheless.
Spiteful, in pain, and alone.

Despite all of that, I prevail. I am successful, I have accomplished things that
people my age have not even dreamed of, and I should probably be proud of this.
I'm not. I feel disappointed, but not unhappy. Never unhappy. How I feel cannot
be described as unhappy, or depressed, or anything of that sort. Neither happy
nor unhappy. Disappointed, at best. Today was a normal day, nothing out of the
ordinary. Yet I feel overwhelmed by disappointment more than ever. Acceptance,
perhaps, of the fact that it is meaningless. Disappointed that knowing how
things will end up in 5 years, 10, pushing onwards as if there is something on
the horizon. Does it matter? I don't know, but I'm not particularly sure if I
care either. I want to give up, with my whole being. I have never been more sure
of something. There is not a doubt in my mind that I want to leave everything
behind. And go where? I don't know. I don't care. Yet I know that even if I did
that, even if I left everything and everyone behind, the ideas and memories
would continue to haunt me as if nothing happened. Such a cost for nothing in
return.

There are many things I have invested in. Not in a way that calls for sunk
costs; I invested willingly, and I don't regret any of it. Not one bit. It is
not like my investments were for nothing either. I have invested my time, my
efforts, and have gained trust in return. Yet, despite it being my choice in the
first place, I feel powerless to betray the trust people have put in me, a trust
I have never shown them. A little funny, perhaps narcissistic. I should be
happy, right? That I was able to gain the trust of people who value me as a
friend, a mentor, or whatever I may be to them. But I don't feel happy. I feel
trapped. The idea of betraying this trust becomes my worst nightmare. If I were
to describe this, I would ask you to imagine gasping for air in between choking
on water while you are drowning. You know what's going to happen. You know
what's next. Yet every single cell in your body _screams_ and _pushes_ for one
more moment of survival. Every nanosecond becomes minutes until it ends.

I enjoy solitude, possibly more than anything else. More than the company of
people I love. It is liberating---not subconsciously overanalyzing every
expression or making small predictions based on clues within a conversation—not
something I do willingly. In fact, for a while now, my dream has been to get my
things and live in the middle of nowhere with not a single soul around. Not one.
I do not care for a warm greeting, I do not care for any appreciation. If we are
going to coexist, let us do so quietly and peacefully. There is not much I can
ask for. Yet it is not what is going to make me not feel whatever this feeling
is called. I find myself yearning for something. It is not solitude, nor
company. It is not some kind of big win that will lift my spirits, and it is not
salvation. I want an end. It is beginning to feel awfully like a boring movie
that I have seen, and I am _dying_ for it to end. In fact, I spite every second
of it. In fact, I sometimes think I thrive under discomfort. My spite for it
makes me take _one more step_, just to spite some imaginary enemy. Laughable,
isn't it?

I would be remiss, however, if I did not point out the irony of it all. This is
all of my own making. I chose to want the things I wanted, do the things I did.
I built a prison, got inside, and locked myself in. I could get out whenever I
wanted to, but I don’t want to be wanting to escape. I want to know that I can
simply curl up somewhere and rot away with everything moving on around me. I
want it so that I can simply _give up_ without the consequences nagging me. Let
me stop grasping for air, and I will be at peace. Though chances are, nothing is
going to change. I am full of spite, regardless of how I feel at any given
moment, and it's not long before I find something to direct it toward. There
will be something to pique my interest and distract me from the fact that I have
not signed up for any of this. That will be the way things are for a while, and
then back to drowning. Each time with more water in my lungs than the last, each
time more aware of the inevitable. This is how I have been doing things for a
while now, and it is probably going to remain that way until the end of time.
Why do I even bother? Let it get worse.

This has been a piece much outside of my usual pace. Truth be told, I am writing
to clear the thoughts in my mind. I don't want them; maybe you do. If you don't,
well, then you should have stopped reading earlier. How about that?
