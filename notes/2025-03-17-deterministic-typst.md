# Building Deterministic Typst Packages with Nix

[Typst Builder PR]: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/369283

Recently, I encountered a [Typst Builder PR] in Nixpkgs that implements a Typst
builder, similar to other language-specific builders you might be familiar with.

While I still use Pandoc and Markdown for many tasks (including this blog), I've
been using Typst extensively recently, and that got me excited to explore the
new builder(s).

To test them, and possibly demonstrate their functionality, I've prepared the
following `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:cherrypiejam/nixpkgs?ref=typst";
  outputs = {nixpkgs, ...}: let
    systems = ["x86_64-linux"];
    forEachSystem = nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs systems;

    pkgsForEach = nixpkgs.legacyPackages;
  in {
    packages = forEachSystem (system: {
      inherit (pkgsForEach.${system}) buildTypstPackage typstPackages;
    });

    devShells = forEachSystem (system: let
      pkgs = pkgsForEach.${system};
    in {
      default = pkgs.mkShellNoCC {
        # packages provided in 'nix develop'
        packages = [
          (pkgs.typst.withPackages (ps:
            with ps; [
              polylux
              cetz_0_3_0
            ]))
        ];
      };
    });
  };
}
```

This flake re-exports `buildTypstPackage` and `typstPackages` from nixpkgs and
uses the new `typst.withPackages` scope to create a deterministic Typst
environment. Its usage, though subject to change, appears straightforward.

`buildTypstPackage` produces a "manifest" of available Typst packages from Typst
Universe, which you can use within `typst.withPackages`'s scope. For example:

```nix
typst.withPackages (ps:
 with ps; [
    polylux
    cetz
 ])
);
```

This allows you to use, for instance, `#import "@preview/cetz:0.3.0: \*"` as
cetz is added to Typst's search path via the `TYPST_PACKAGE_CACHE_PATH` variable
set to, e.g.,
`/nix/store/02pgr69nc5lczi9rrh2xd40s1mzqrvkl-typst-0.13.1-env/lib/typst/packages`,
populated with the packages in your scope.

## Closing Thoughts

I encourage you to review the [Typst Builder PR]. It seems nearly ready and will
likely be included in nixpkgs soon. If you want to try it out now, consider
examining the example flake I've provided above.
