# System Backlight

## The Problem

Following a large system upgrade two days ago, my HP Pavilion laptop has stopped
registering the `intel_backlight` device interface in `/sys/class/backlight` -
which is most often used by tools such as `brightnessctl` or `light` to control
active backlight level. Instinctively looking at the result of `dmesg`, I came
across an insanely vague error message that the kernel was unable to load some
modules. Thanks, I guess?

## The solution

[forum post]: https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/brightness-keys-not-working-after-updating-to-kernel-version-6-a-4175720728/
[kernel command-line options]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/backlight#Kernel_command-line_options

After some _ very extensive_ research, obviously on Google as every other
confused Linux user would do, I came across this [forum post] that mentioned a
change in backlight behaviour sometime after kernel version `6.1.4`. Fortunately
for me, the article was also referring to the ever so informative Archwiki that
instructed passing one of the three [kernel command-line options] depending on
our needs.

What I did not know at the time was that when I upgraded my kernel from `6.1.3`
to `6.1.6` with a `nix flake update`, the `acpi_backlight=none` parameter had
made it so that it would skip loading Intel backlight _entirely_. Simply
switching this parameter to `acpi_backlight=native` as per the article above has
fixed the issue.

## Lessons learned

Linux devs are nerds.
