# About

I work with Nix quite often, and share some of the stuff I learn while I do so.
This website contains various notes on things that interested me, or things I
thought was worth sharing. If you would like to contribute, or have any feedback
you think would be useful, please feel free to reach out to me via email,
available at my GitHub profile or [on my website](https://notashelf.dev).

If my notes helped you in any way, that is great! That means my time spent
writing those notes were very well spent. If you were _already_ a Nix/NixOS
expert who somehow found their way to here, and got really bored (...or
disgusted) while reading my notes, then I only ask that you point out my
mistakes as you spot them. Your kindless would be very much appreciated.

If you are a reader looking for some pro tips, I would like to remind you that I
am not an expert in Nix or NixOS. My notes are limited by my own knowledge.
However, I would be happy to try and answer your questions nevertheless; and we
can try figuring out the answer together, should we both happen to be stuck.

If you spot a mistake, please let me know and I would be happy to learn from
you. Thanks!
